Difference between Heap and Stack Memory in java. And how java utilizes this.


Stack memory is the portion of memory that was assigned to every individual program. And it was fixed. On the other hand, Heap memory is the portion that was not allocated to the java program but it will be available for use by the java program when it is required, mostly during the runtime of the program.

Java Utilizes this memory as - 

When we write a java program then all the variables, methods, etc are stored in the stack memory.
And when we create any object in the java program then that object was created in the heap memory. And it was referenced from the stack memory.
